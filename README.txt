--------
OVERVIEW

This is to present a sample implementation of high frame rate vision
processing with OpenCV, in which a separate GUI thread is arranged so
that it does not disturb a higher-rate vision processing thread as
best it can.  The implementation runs a target tracking demonstration
at over 450 fps with a Point Grey Research USB 3.0 camera and a note
PC.

Basically, the two (or more) threads run independently while the
communication between them is done in a message-passing manner.  The
message passing link is designed with the policies and assumptions
that (1) overhead of data copy is minimized, (2) the slower GUI thread
should not disturb the faster vision processing thread, and (3) a
message may be dropped if the slower receiving thread cannot handle
it.

The project contains three modules: 

- msglink: a simple thread-to-thread message-passing utility designed
  with the above policies.

- multi_threaded_cap: a sample program using msglink that simply
  captures and displays a video sequence from a standard web camera
  (which OpenCV can recognize). 

- target_track: a sample program using msglink that demonstrates a
  template-match tracking with a Point Grey Research camera (which
  the Point Grey FlyCapture driver can recognize). 


----------
DEPENDENCY

- msglink depends on Boost (tested with Boost 1.47.0)

- multi_threaded_cap depends on OpenCV 2.x (tested with OpenCV 2.3.1),
  Boost and msglink.

- target_track depends on OpenCV, Boost, FlyCapture (tested with
  FlyCapture2-2.3.3.19) and msglink.

They are tested in Windows 7 Professional (x64) with Visual Studio
2008, but are not meant to be dependent on the Windows platform. 


-------------
BUILD AND RUN

Make sure the above prerequisite libraries are installed and the
include/library paths are appropriately set.  Note that we are using
the old FlyCapture 1.x API and thus FC1 directory of the FlyCapture
library needs to be in the library path. 

If you are using Visual Studio, start highspeed_cam_opencv.sln to open
the solution.  The projects for multi_threaded_cap and target_track
are in it, for which the following settings are already done. 

multi_threaded_cap: 

 - Link with opencv_core***.lib, opencv_imgproc***.lib, and
   opencv_highgui***.lib (where *** are the version number). 

 - Put the path where msglink.hpp lies into the additional include
   directory (e.g. ../msglink). 

 - When run, it requires a camera recognizable by OpenCV. 

 - Hit any key to quit. 

target_track: 

 - Link with opencv_core***.lib, opencv_imgproc***.lib,
   opencv_highgui***.lib (where *** are the version number), and
   PGRFlyCapture.lib.

 - Put the path where msglink.hpp lies into the additional include
   directories setting (e.g. ../msglink). 

 - When run, it requires a monochrome Point Grey Research camera
   recognizable by the FlyCapture driver.  To use another camera (say,
   a color camera), see the comment around the class
   VideoCaptureFlyCap in target_track.cpp. 

 - Left click to choose (the center of) a new target. 

 - Hit any key to quit.
